# Linux
I got VirtualBox 6.0 installed. I am using Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS.


    # This repository demonstrates what I know about Linux operating system.
    # I have the basic working knowledge about the Linux CLI.
    # In a professional arena, if I need to learn more, hopefully, this basic knowledge will help me to easily pick up
              the advanced topics of Linux CLI.
    
    # In summary, you will find me comfortable with tasks that require a basic understanding of Linux CLI.
