.bashrc file is a script that executes whenever a session starts.
If it does not exist, we can create it.


fokhrul@fokhrul-VirtualBox:~$ pwd
/home/fokhrul
fokhrul@fokhrul-VirtualBox:~$ ls -a           ;See the .bashrc file in the first column
.              Downloads         Pictures

.bash_history  .gnupg            Public
.bash_logout   .ICEauthority     .sudo_as_admin_successful
.bashrc        .lesshst          Templates

.cache         .mozilla          Videos
.config        Music             winter.txt

Documents      out.txt
fokhrul@fokhrul-VirtualBox:~$ nano .bashrc    ;we can create or edit a .bashrc file
fokhrul@fokhrul-VirtualBox:~$ gedit .bashrc   ;It's like a text editor. We can edit the file



###This is interesting. If we want to see some message at the beginning of each session, we can do it.
      Just edit the .bashrc file and at the end of the file add the following command:
      
      echo "Welcome to the terminal. Hope you are doing great!"
      
Save the file. Close the terminal and reopen it. The message will be echoed at the top of the terminal.
